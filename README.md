# Python-Module-End-Assignment-
Comprehensive Assessment


Overview:
This project helps in exploring how employees are distributed among teams based on positions, age, and salary expenditures.  it also examines employee data and the correlation between age and salary. Python is used for the analysis, together with  Seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy libraries. The "salary - myexcel.csv" dataset, which includes data about employees' teams, positions, ages, salaries, and heights, was used for this analysis.

Preprocessing:

I used pandas to load the dataset. Then created random height settings for workers. After that looked over the dataset's basic statistics and structure. finally made sure the data was consistent.

Analysis Tasks:

1. Distribution of employees based on team: Found how many workers were on each squad. I also Determined the split percentage to the total number of workers and then presented the distribution graphically with a bar plot.
2. Segregation of employees based on Position: Workers were divided into groups according to their roles within the organization. Then used a bar plot to visualize the position based distribution.
3. Predominant age group among employees: Determined which age groups are most common among employees. Then used a bar plot to visualize the age based distribution.
4. Which team and position have the highest salary expenditure: Using groupby found teams based and position based salary expenditure. Found out which position and team spend the most on salaries. Then used bar graphs to visualize the team and position based salary expenditure separately.
5. Correlation between age and salary:  used a scatter plot to visually depict the correlation.

Insights Gained:

1. Team Distribution: The team with most number of employees is New Orleans Pelicans which shows that they have the highest need of employees.
2. Position Distribution: This helps in identifying the most popular positions held by employees. Which are SG, SF, and PF. This helps in comprehending how jobs and talent are distributed around the company.
3. Age Group: The majority of employees fall into a specific age range, the predominant age group within the company fall within the 25-30 age range., showing that they have more of young or middle-aged workforce.
4. Salary Expenditure: Certain teams and positions command higher salaries, highest salary expenditure indicate which roles are most valued.
5. Age-Salary Correlation: The scatter plot reveals how salary scales with age, providing insights into the company's practices. Ages around 23-33 have higher salaries compared to others.
